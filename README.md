# My Dev Notebook

Hullo! ðŸ‘‹

This Repo **coredump.dev** is my "second brain". It is a collection of technical notes, code-snippets, scripts, and command reference for various tools.

> :warning: Notes might be outdated as product changes overtime. I may not be able to keep all notes up-to-date but I'll do my best to keep up with the latest changes & releases.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to maintain these notes and the folder `dev-notes` is the vault.

## Dev Environment Files
